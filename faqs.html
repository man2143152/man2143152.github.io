		<h3>How dark can windows be tinted?</h3>
			<p>In Arizona, the state requires vehicle owners to have no darker than 35% tint on the 2 front windows. All other windows can be tinted as dark as the owner prefers.</p>
		<h3>How long before you can roll down the windows?</h3>
			<p>Typically, we ask customers to refrain from rolling down their windows for a minimum of 3 days and upwards to 5 days.</p>
		<h3>Why are prices different depending on the vehicle?</h3>
			<p>Factors we take into consideration when quoting are the amount of windows on the vehicle and the shape/curve of the windows. Not all vehicles are the same and some require more time to install than others.</p>
		<h3>How long will it take to remove tint and/or tint your vehicle?</h3>
			<p>The process of removing tint and re-tinting a vehicle is very rigorous and we take our time cleaning up all old residue left over by the old tint before applying the new film. This can take upwards to 5 hours.</p>
		<h3>Can we keep the defroster when removing old tint?</h3>
			<p>We try our best to remove old tint from the rear window using steam to keep the defroster fully functional, however, we can't guarantee that will be the same result for everyone. Some times we have no other option but to scrape the rear defroster along with the tint.</p>
		<h3>Does the window tint go on the outside or inside?</h3>
			<p>Tint is cut and molded on the outside of the vehicle. After the prep work is done the tint will be installed on the inside.</p>
		<h3>What tint do we use?</h3>
			<p>We use MaxPro Films.</p>
		<h3>What tint color do we have?</h3>
		<p>We usually use charcoal black for all the services we provide, however, if customers prefer a different color for residential/commercial services we are more than glad to order a tint color of your liking. Keep in mind we will have to cahrge in advance to special order the tint color.</p>
